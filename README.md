# To compile the jar files:
#1 add the file extension.java instead of .txt
#2 open the terminal or command prompt and run "javac NameOfFile.java" 
#This will create a new file with the .class extension
#To run the .class file, in the terminal or command prompt run "java NameOfFile"
#Note that to do this you need to have the Java JDK installed
